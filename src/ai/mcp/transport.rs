/// of forced spacing between two requests to the same endpoint, so a single
/// MCP server would cost ~1.2s for the handshake and ~2.4s to reach
/// `tools/list` — paid per server, sequentially, on every cold cache or 60s
/// TTL expiry. A user's own MCP servers are not that: they are their
/// endpoints, reached a handful of times per cache refresh, and pre-0.6 the
/// transport paced them not at all. Everything else in `RetryConfig` — the
/// retry schedule, the per-endpoint concurrency cap, the 429/`Retry-After`
/// cool-down — is genuine robustness, already bounded by [`CONNECT_TIMEOUT`]
/// and [`LIST_TOOLS_TIMEOUT`], and stays at its default. LLM traffic
/// (`ai::catalog`, one `HttpClient::new()` per provider row) keeps the
/// defaults wholesale.
